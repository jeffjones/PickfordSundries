<p class="excerpt">Jeff was born and raised in Lutz, FL and still lives in Tampa. Thats right, he's a real live florida native. And you though they were just a mythical beast, never to be actually found in the real world.  </p>

After surving, with minimal long term damage, being bussed all around the Tampa's wonderful school system he eventually found his way to Gaither High School and spent most of his time at school either singing in Chorus or singing and dancing in Showcase, the schools most excellent show band. (For those of you who did not get to witness it and are having a hard time imagaining Jeff singing and dancing, rest assured he can not quite comprehend that fact either.) After high school Jeff pursued a degree in Aerospace engineering until he came to his senses at the end of his Junior year and dropped out of college to take over a small independant music store, the Bluegrass Parlor. </p>

Something that you may not have know about Jeff is that he is an experienced commercial sewer, errrr try seamstress, no still not quite right, ok how about sewing machine operator. Well, a bit awkward, but lets go with sewing machine operator. He worked throughout high school at his uncle's canvas business making tarps and other large and mostly flat textile products. Later, while finishing his degree in Environmental Science at USF he sewed, small and not at all flat, Wingsuit Skydiving suits at Tonysuits in Zephyrhills. </p>

Currently work at an environmental consulting firm doing GIS(computer mapping) work on Watershed moddelling projects, and most importantly being a husband to his wife Terri and a father to his new son Everett.
